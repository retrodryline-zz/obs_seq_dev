# obs_seq_dev
Methodology from dissertation for combining obs types, 'super-obing', and parsing (i.e. WTX meso only) for WRF-DART system (RMA branch)

#obs_seq directory of obs files before processed and combined in: /glade/p/work/brockb/obs_seq on yellowstone.ucar.edu
#note processing of obs_seq (converting to DART format) done in /glade/p/work/brockb/DART/observations (NOT in RMA branch which was downloaded and used as filter at a later date than obs_seq files were produced).
